Legacy PunkBuster Files for PBBans protected Servers

Normally you can download all legacy PB files here from the PBBans Website, but for some reason sometime its broken:
https://community.pbbans.com/files/category/7-legacy-punkbuster-files/

There for i upload those PB Files here, for the games i host Servers myself.
Checkout my Servers listed up on Discord: https://discord.gg/A7vtjmw


pbgame.htm
 
is the file of the pbsetup.exe, just download it https://evenbalance.com/pbsetup.php and replace the lines with mine and you are able to update
BF2 & BF2142 instead of doing it manually. It is showing you also the PB version your games are on.

This is more useful for developers not for clients, because also all other files are still on the evenbalance servers. In theory clients could use autoupdater function pushed by the servers https://www.evenbalance.com/downloads/bf2/pbsec.htm so there is no need to run Servers without PunkBuster also in 2021.
